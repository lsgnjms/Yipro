                Market access plays a crucial role in reducing post-harvest losses.
                When farmers face poor road networks, long distances to markets, or lack of reliable buyers, 
                perishable produce often spoils before it can be sold. Improving access to markets enables faster sales, 
                reduces spoilage, and increases farmers‚Äô income.

1. **Market Location Access:**  
   In **five out of six geo-zones** (North Central, North East, North West, South West, and South South), more farmers access markets located **in their Local Government Area (LGA)** rather than within their own community. This may indicate a **lack of nearby or functional community markets**, suggesting a need for **infrastructure investment or market development closer to farms**, particularly in rural zones.

2. **Transport Challenges:**  
   A majority of farmers (**53.29%**) rely on **tricycles or motorcycles** to transport produce, followed by **car/vans (21.5%)** and **on foot (19.8%)**. This heavy reliance on two-wheelers and walking implies **inadequate transport infrastructure** or lack of affordable alternatives, which may **contribute to post-harvest losses**, especially in remote areas.

üí° **Suggested Intervention Focus:**  
Investments in **local market infrastructure** and **rural road networks**, as well as **affordable and reliable transportation options**, could significantly reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access for farmers.
